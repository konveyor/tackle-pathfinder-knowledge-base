Tackle Pathfinder is one of the open-source tools of the [Konveyor Community](https://www.konveyor.io)
to assess your app portfolio to getting containerization recommendations, to automated
testing for your modernized app into Kubernetes platforms.

[Tackle Pathfinder](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-pathfinder) is a questionnaire
based tool that assesses the suitability of applications for modernization in order
to be deployed in Containers on an enterprise Kubernetes platform. Through
interaction with the questionnaire, and review process, the system is enriched
with application knowledge which is exposed via a collection of reports.
The reports provide information about applications’ suitability for Kubernetes
highlight associated risks, and generate an adoption plan informed by the
applications’ prioritization, business criticality and dependencies.

This repo includes a set of recommendations to be used as standard knowledge base
for each of the questions in a Pathfinder report when some of the topics are
identified as `High` or `Medium`.
